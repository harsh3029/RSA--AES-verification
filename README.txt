HOW TO RUN THE CODE

Step 1 : run server.py file using "python server.py"
Step 2 : run client.py file using "python client.py"

aes_en.py contains the code to encrypt the plaintext using simple AES algorithm as given.

aes_de.py contains the code to decrypt the ciphertext using simple AES algorithm as given.

client.py contains socket code for client side.

server.py contains socket code for server side.

rsa.py contains the functions for RSA algorithm and converting the text to digest.

All the functions used are having names as per their uses.
